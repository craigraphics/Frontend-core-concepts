## NVM
NVM stands for Node Version Manager. It is a command-line tool written in bash scripting language used to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

NVM allows you to install and switch between different versions of Node.js, enabling the use of specific versions for different projects. This is extremely helpful in situations where various projects might require different Node.js versions.

As a front-end developer, you might find NVM useful to align your development environment with the specific requirements of your projects, thus avoiding any potential version conflicts and ensuring compatibility.

If you require further information or guidance on how to use NVM, please let me know.

Node Version Manager (NVM) comes with several essential commands that allow you to manage different Node.js versions with ease. Here's a summary of some of the most important command lines:

   ```
   This command installs a specific version of Node.js.

2. **Listing Installed Versions**: 
   ```bash
   nvm ls
   ```
   This displays a list of all installed Node.js versions on your system.

3. **Using a Specific Version**: 
   ```bash
   nvm use <version>
   ```
   This command switches to a specific version of Node.js for the current terminal session.

4. **Setting a Default Version**:
