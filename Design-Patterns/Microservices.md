Microservices, also known as the microservices architecture, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each of these services corresponds to a specific business functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Unlike monolithic architectures, where different components of an application are interconnected and interdependent, microservices offer a decentralized approach to building software systems.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice focuses on a single functionality. This makes it easier to understand, develop, and maintain individual services.

2. **Independence**: Microservices can operate independently of each other. This means that a change in one service doesn't require a change in another, which streamlines the development process and minimizes the scope of regression testing.

3. **Decentralized Data Management**: Each service has its own database, allowing it to be decoupled from other services.

4. **Technology Agnostic**: Different microservices can be written in different programming languages, and use different data storage technologies.

5. **Scalability**: Microservices can be easily scaled independently. If a particular function experiences more load, only the corresponding service needs to be scaled.

6. **Fault Isolation**: A failure in one service doesn't directly affect others. This is essential for building robust systems.

7. **Location Transparency**: Microservices can be located anywhere - whether it's in the same data center, or distributed across multiple data centers globally.

8. **Communication**: Typically, microservices communicate using standard HTTP REST APIs, although other forms like message queues can also be used.

### Advantages

- **Flexibility in Technology Stack**: Different teams can use different technologies best suited for their service.
  
- **Easy Deployment and Scaling**: Each service can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently.

- **Resilience**: Failure of one service has less impact on the entire application.

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple services, databases, and their inter-communications can become complex.

- **Data Consistency**: With each microservice managing its own database, ensuring data consistency across services can be challenging.

- **Network Latency**: Communication between multiple services over a network can introduce latency and can impact performance.

In the IT industry, microservices have gained significant attention for their ability to accelerate development cycles, enable scalability, and allow technology stack diversity. However, they also introduce complexities that organizations need to manage carefully.
