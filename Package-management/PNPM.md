## PNPM (Performant NPM)
PNPM (Performant NPM) is a package manager for Node.js that aims to improve upon the limitations of the standard npm package manager. Here's how PNPM works:

1. **Efficient Storage**: PNPM uses a content-addressable file system to store packages. This means that instead of storing a copy of each package for every project that uses it, PNPM stores a single copy and creates hard links to it. This results in significantly less disk space usage compared to npm.

2. **Dependency Isolation**: PNPM isolates dependencies for each project, ensuring that different projects can have different versions of the same dependency installed without conflicts. This is achieved through the use of virtual stores, which provide a separate dependency tree for each project.

3. **Monorepo Support**: PNPM is well-suited for managing monorepos, where multiple projects are maintained in a single repository. It provides features like workspace detection and shared dependencies, making it easier to manage dependencies across multiple projects.

4. **Faster Installs**: PNPM claims to be faster than npm for package installations, especially for large projects, due to its efficient storage and dependency management.

5. **Lockfile Compatibility**: PNPM is designed to be compatible with the standard npm lockfile format (package-lock.json), making it easier to switch between npm and PNPM for different projects.

6. **Symlinked Dependencies**: PNPM uses symlinks instead of copying files, which can result in faster installs and smaller disk footprints.

7. **Deterministic Installations**: PNPM guarantees that the same set of dependencies will be installed every time, regardless of the order in which they are listed in the package.json file.

Overall, PNPM aims to provide a more efficient and scalable package management solution for Node.js projects, particularly for large-scale applications and monorepos. It offers various improvements over the standard npm package manager in terms of storage, dependency management, and performance.
