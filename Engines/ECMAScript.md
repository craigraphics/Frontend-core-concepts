## ECMAScript

ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International, a non-profit organization. It serves as the foundation for several programming languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. ECMAScript was initially created to standardize JavaScript, which had become fragmented due to multiple implementations by various vendors.

ECMAScript defines:

1. **Syntax Rules**: It specifies the rules for writing programs, such as keywords, operators, and basic syntax rules.
   
2. **Types**: The type system, including primitives like `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, and complex types like `Object` and `Array`, is defined.
  
3. **Objects**: Built-in objects that provide utility functions and properties. For example, it defines the `Math` object for mathematical operations, the `Date` object for date and time manipulations, and so on.
  
4. **Functions**: Describes how functions should be defined, called, and manipulated.
  
5. **Statements and Control Structures**: Enumerates various control structures like loops, conditionals, and error handling mechanisms like `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.
  
6. **Asynchronous Operations**: Although traditional ECMAScript was single-threaded, recent versions have included provisions for asynchronous programming, like Promises and `async/await`.
  
7. **Modularity**: It specifies how code can be modularized and reused, primarily through the `import` and `export` statements in recent versions.
  
8. **Execution Context**: Describes how the runtime environment should manage the execution context and scope chains.
  
9. **Error Handling**: Provides a framework for throwing and catching errors, including built-in error types like `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, etc.
  
10. **Interoperability**: Aims to ensure that the code is interoperable across different host environments, although the specific host objects are usually beyond the scope of the ECMAScript specification itself.

ECMAScript undergoes periodic updates, often referred to by the year they were finalized (e.g., ES6 is ECMAScript 2015, ES7 is ECMAScript 2016, and so on). These updates introduce new features, optimizations, and syntactical constructs to keep the language modern and capable.
