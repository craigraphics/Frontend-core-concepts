## Gathering, classifying and analyzing requirements for large scale systems

System requirements means to figure out and narrow down what exactly needs to be built for the client.

## Challenges
1. Scope and level of abstraction - we need to understand the problem to also understand the complexity.
2. Level of ambiguity - it's important to clarify all the requirements for that system. Asking the questions to clarify.

## Types of Requirements or architectural drivers
### 1. Features of the System - functional requirements.
   - They describe the system's behavior. 
   - Easily tied to the objective of the system.
   - Functional requirements do not determine its architecture.
### 3. Quality attributes - non-functional requirements
   - Are properties that the system must have as opposed to what the system must do.
   - Scability, Availability, Reliablity, Security, Performance.
   - Quality attributes do dictate the software architecture of our system.
### 4. system constrains - limitations and boundaries
  - Time constraints
  - Financial constraints
  - Staffing constraints
