## NPM Modules

NPM (Node Package Manager) modules are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate specific functionalities and can be easily distributed and shared across different projects. These modules are commonly used in Node.js and front-end development to provide pre-written functionality that developers can integrate into their own applications. The primary objective is to enhance code reusability and maintainability while also potentially saving development time.

Modules available through NPM can range from simple utility libraries like `lodash` to complex frameworks like `express`. They are hosted in the NPM registry and can be downloaded and installed using the NPM CLI (Command-Line Interface).

### Local Modules
When you install an NPM module locally, it gets downloaded and stored inside the `node_modules` directory within your project folder. Local modules are accessible only within the scope of the project where you installed them. This localized installation ensures that different projects don't interfere with each other by using different versions of the same module.

To install a local module, you generally run:

```bash
npm install <module_name>
```

In your JavaScript file, you would then `require` the module like so:

```javascript
const moduleName = require('module_name');
```

### Global Modules
Global modules, on the other hand, are installed system-wide and can be accessed by any Node.js project running on your system. These are often command-line utilities or other modules that don't necessarily need to be part of a specific project's dependency tree.

To install a global module, you generally run:

```bash
npm install -g <module_name>
```

However, it's important to note that global modules are generally not `require`-able within your Node.js projects. They are accessible through the command line or possibly through your system's PATH environment.

### Key Differences
1. **Scope**: Local modules are project-specific, while global modules are system-wide.
2. **Accessibility**: Local modules need to be `required` in the project's code, while global modules are usually command-line utilities and not meant to be `required` in a project.
3. **Versioning**: Local modules allow for different projects to use different versions of the same module, thereby avoiding potential conflicts. Global modules do not offer this flexibility.
4. **Storage**: Local modules are stored in a project's `node_modules` directory, whereas global modules are stored in a global directory that depends on your operating system and Node.js setup.

I hope this clarifies your understanding of NPM modules and the differences between local and global installations. Would you like to know more about any specific aspect?
